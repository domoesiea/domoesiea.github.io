        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Domo Adama. I am currently in my fifth year at ESIEA, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a specialization in Statistics and Computer Science. Passionate about data and AI, I strive to develop innovative predictive models and solve complex problems using advanced data analysis techniques.</p>
        <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained a solid understanding of statistics, programming, and machine learning algorithms. My practical experience includes completing academic projects and internships, where I applied my skills to analyze data, develop predictive models, and automate processes. I am particularly interested in the development of knowledge-based intelligent agents, a field of AI that aims to create systems capable of reasoning and making informed decisions.</p>
        <p>One of the notable projects I have worked on is OpenDomX, where we connected devices that do not necessarily use the same communication protocols. We studied the security of these connected devices and developed a mobile application to control them. This project involved a deep dive into IoT security and the integration of various technologies to create a cohesive system.</p>
        <p>I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and apply my skills. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential projects or collaborations.</p>
