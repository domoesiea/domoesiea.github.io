                <p> Hello, my name is Domo Adama. I am currently in my fifth year at ESIEA, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a specialization in Statistics and Computer Science. Passionate about data and AI. I strive to develop innovative predictive models and solve complex problems using advanced data analysis techniques.</p>
                <p> Throughout my studies, I have gained a solid understanding of statistics, programming, machine learning algorithms, and the development of expert systems. My practical experience includes completing academic projects and internships, where I applied my skills to analyze data, develop predictive models, automate processes, and create systems that can reason and make informed decisions based on expert knowledge.</p>
                <p> My recent work also includes developing a prediction method with a relative error of 0.08, demonstrating my ability to create precise and reliable models for real-world applications.</p>
                <p> I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, innovate, and apply my skills in AI. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential projects or collaborations.</p>
